""" byte array based binary search

File organization:

The file *cuisourceinfo-3-30-term-dictionary* is a binary file of
records, all the same length with each record containing a term, the
number of postings for that term and address of the posting extents
for that term:

    |       term in bytes          | # of postings | address |
